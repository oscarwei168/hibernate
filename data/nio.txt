Java NIO Buffers are used when interacting with NIO Channels. As you know, data is read from channels into buffers, and written from buffers into channels.

A buffer is essentially a block of memory into which you can write data, which you can then later read again. This memory block is wrapped in a NIO Buffer object, which provides a set of methods that makes it easier to work with the memory block.
